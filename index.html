		<p><div id="specialStyle">Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced surfers paddle into,</div> or are towed into, waves which are at least 20 
		feet (6.2 m) high, on surf boards known as "guns" or towboards.<br>
		[1] Sizes of the board needed to successfully surf these waves vary by the size of the wave as 
		well as the technique the surfer uses to reach the wave. A larger, longer board allows a rider to 
		paddle fast enough to catch the wave and has the advantage of being more stable, but it also 
		limits maneuverability and surfing speed.

		<hr>
		<p>In 1992, big wave surfers such as Buzzy Kerbox,<span style="color:red"> Laird Hamilton and Darrick Doerner 
		introduced a cross over sport called tow-in surfing</span>.[4] While many riders still participate in both sports, 
		they remain very distinct activities. This type of surfing involves being towed into massive waves by jet ski,
		allowing for the speed needed to successfully ride. Tow-in surfing also revolutionized board size, 
		allowing surfers to trade in their unwieldy 12 ft. boards in favor of light, 7 ft boards that allowed for more 
		speed and easier maneuvrability in waves over 30 ft (10 meters). By the end of the 1990s, tow in surfing 
		allowed surfers to ride waves exceeding 50 ft (15 meters).
